PERSONAL WEBSITE
############


My personal website displaying a few projects I have done with the ability to download/view youtube demos. The website itself showcases some of my HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and SASS skills. I learned SASS on the fly to build this website as a result of CSS being "boring" for me. This website will be my personal playground, you may come back in a year and find it to be totally revamped or maybe have a mini-game.
